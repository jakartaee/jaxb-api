/**
 * A basic event handler interface for validation errors.
 *
 * <p>
 * If an application needs to implement customized event handling, it must
 * implement this interface and then register it with either the 
 * {@link Unmarshaller#setEventHandler(ValidationEventHandler) Unmarshaller}, or
 * the {@link Marshaller#setEventHandler(ValidationEventHandler) Marshaller}.  
 * The Jakarta XML Binding Provider will then report validation errors and warnings encountered
 * during the unmarshal, marshal, and validate operations to these event 
 * handlers.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code handleEvent} method throws an unchecked runtime exception,
 * the Jakarta XML Binding Provider must treat that as if the method returned false, effectively
 * terminating whatever operation was in progress at the time (unmarshal, 
 * validate, or marshal).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Modifying the Java content tree within your event handler is undefined
 * by the specification and may result in unexpected behaviour.
 *
 * <p>
 * Failing to return false from the {@code handleEvent} method after
 * encountering a fatal error is undefined by the specification and may result 
 * in unexpected behavior.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Default Event Handler</b>
 * <blockquote>
 *    If the client application does not set an event handler on their
 *    {@code Unmarshaller}, or {@code Marshaller} prior to
 *    calling the validate, unmarshal, or marshal methods, then a default event
 *    handler will receive notification of any errors or warnings encountered.
 *    The default event handler will cause the current operation to halt after
 *    encountering the first error or fatal error (but will attempt to continue
 *    after receiving warnings).
